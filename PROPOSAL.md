# Spot On Project Proposal

## Project Description 

My web-based game is Spot On. It's a playful daily* quiz game where players test both their visual knowledge and quick decision making by swiping a photo toward the (hopefully) correct of two presented words. Scoring is based on accuracy and overall speed. There are three difficulty levels. In the future I'd like to authenticate players and allow them to connect with their friends to take part in private leaderboards.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want to land on the game's page and be able to start the game in one tap/click.
- As a player, I want to be able to easily swipe/toss the photo left or right depending on which answer I think is correct.
- As a player on a non-touch-based device, I want to still have fun playing the game even when actual swiping isn't possible, with the ease/difficuly being as close as feasibly possible to touch-based players.
- As a player, I want to feel positive vibes when I get an answer correct and negative yet playful ones when incorrect.
- As a player, I want to keep track of my progress/score while I play.
- As a player, I want to see my results at the end of the game.
- As a player, I want to share my results to friends, etc. with simple emoji based message.
- As a player, I want to be able to see/play recent "daily" puzzles.

#### Stretch Goals

- As a returning player, I want to be welcomed back and be able to see my past results.

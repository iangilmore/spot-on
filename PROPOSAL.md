# Spot On Project Proposal

## Project Description 

My web-based game is Spot On. It's a playful daily* quiz game where players test both their visual knowledge and quick decision making by swiping a photo toward the (hopefully) correct of two presented words. Results will display accuracy and overall speed. There are three difficulty levels. In the future I'd like to authenticate players and allow them to connect with their friends to take part in private leaderboards.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want to land on the game's page and quickly be able to start the game in one tap/click.
- As a player, I want to be able to easily swipe/toss the photo left or right depending on which answer I think is correct.
- As a player on a non-touch-based device, I want to have fun playing the game even when touch isn't possible, with the ease/difficuly being the same touch-based players.
- As a player, I want to get positive feedback when I get an answer correct and negative yet playful feedback when incorrect.
- As a player, I want to keep track of my progress/score while I play.
- As a player, I want to see my results at the end of the game.
- As a player, I want to share my results to friends, etc.

#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I want to game's look to match my device setting (dark/light), maybe allow for overriding in a settings menu
- As a player, I want to review what I got wrong to learn the correct answer
- As a player, I want to be able to see/play recent "daily" puzzles
- As a returning player, I want to be welcomed back and be able to see my past results
- As a player, I want to be able to see/compare my results against my friends

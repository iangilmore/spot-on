## About

Spot On is a browser-based game where players test their knowledge and quick decision making by swiping photos in the direction of the matching word as quickly as possible. The game provides a fun interaction model and an engaging challenge across three different difficuly levels.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

You can play Spot On at [Netlify](https://spot-on-game-ian-gilmore.netlify.app/) and [Vercel](https://spot-on-game-ian-gilmore.vercel.app/) directly in your mobile or desktop web browser. You can also  clone this repo and run it locally (VS Code + [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension works well). To play, simply select your preferred level then start swiping each image toward the word you think matches it. Good luck!

- Add a "review details" screen where a player can review what they got right/wrong, perhaps provide links to learn more about each image/topic.

Enjoy playing!
